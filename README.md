= Nyfyk

Nyfyk is a RSS Reader HTML5 app that will only work with very modern browsers, see <http://caniuse.com/#search=flex> for my definiton of modern. It's code is an adaptation of the wReader chrome app linked below. It uses [Newsbeuter](http://newsbeuter.org), a RSS CLI program with SQLite3 as backend. [Openresty](http://openresty.org) serves as the middleware between SQLite3 and the front end app, just because I love me some openresty. 

### Why ?

Why not? It's fun!

### What's with the name?

Nyfyk is a play on words in Norwegian where Ny means New and just like in english the start of the word for News. Fyk's literal meaning is "fly", also used about journalist slang "Bladfyk". This makes Nyfyk's meaning "Running after News", or "Running after New stuff", sort of.
